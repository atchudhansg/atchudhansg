# About Me

AI Engineer specializing in Generative AI, Computer Vision, and full-stack systems. I translate research into production solutions using deep learning, multimodal frameworks, and robust engineering practices.

Currently pursuing Computer Science (AI/ML) at VIT Chennai. Ex-Intern at Larsen and Toubro. Delivered solutions across healthcare AI, Software Defined Vehicles (SDVs), compiler optimization, and financial intelligence.

## Key Projects

**[NeuroGPT: AI-Powered MRI Insights](https://github.com/atchudhansg/NeuroGPT-AI-Powered-MRI-Insights-Reporting)**  
Multimodal AI framework for neuroimaging diagnostics. 99.68% specificity, 70% reduction in documentation time.

**[Generative Medical Imaging Pipeline](https://github.com/atchudhansg/MRI-Modality-Translation)**  
GAN-based MRI modality translation with Grad-CAM interpretability. ~88% SSIM. Under review (Elsevier, IF 2.1).

**[OptiMap: AI Compiler for pPIM](https://github.com/atchudhansg/OptiMap-Compiler)**  
Compiler for 24-bit Processor-in-Memory architectures with AI-guided optimization.

**[Financial Intelligence Platform](https://github.com/atchudhansg/Financial-Data-Analysis-Stock-Prediction-with-ML-Web-Scraping)**  
Market analysis pipeline with transformer-based sentiment analysis. 60% reduction in manual workflows.

**[Unreal FPS AI Prototype](https://github.com/atchudhansg/GameDevProject)**  
UE5-based first-person shooter prototype. Implements player controls, weapon mechanics, and Blueprint-based AI with patrol, detection, and attack behavior. Built as a sandbox to explore gameplay logic and AI systems in Unreal Engine.
