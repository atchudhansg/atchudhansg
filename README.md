# About Me

I am an AI and Data Science enthusiast currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science Engineering with specialization in (AI & Machine Learning) from VIT Chennai. I excel in designing scalable, data-driven systems that leverage advanced machine learning, computer vision, and cloud technologies to solve complex challenges.

## Notable Projects

### Deep Learning, Computer Vision & Generative AI
- **[NeuroGPT: AI-Powered MRI Insights & Reporting](https://github.com/atchudhansg/NeuroGPT-AI-Powered-MRI-Insights-Reporting)**  
  A multimodal framework that integrates segmented MRI features with patient data for enhanced brain imaging interpretation. It improves 3D lesion detection and automates report generation using Generative AI.
  
- **[MRI Modality Translation](https://github.com/atchudhansg/MRI-Modality-Translation)**  
  Advanced AI system that transforms between MRI modalities using GAN-based architectures and interpretability techniques. The solution delivers top-tier anatomical similarity and pixel-level accuracy, streamlining diagnostic workflows. Currently under review at an Elsevier journal, Impact Factor 2.1.

### Cloud & Serverless Solutions
- **[Serverless Face Identity Verification](https://github.com/atchudhansg/Serverless-Face-Identity-Verification-Using-AWS-Rekognition)**  
  A robust, serverless system using AWS Rekognition, Lambda, S3, and DynamoDB for secure and efficient facial identity verification, reducing retrieval times and operational costs while achieving 99% accuracy.

### Data Analytics & Financial Modeling
- **[Financial Data Analysis & Stock Prediction](https://github.com/atchudhansg/Financial-Data-Analysis-Stock-Prediction-with-ML-Web-Scraping)**  
  Machine learning models with web scraping to perform real-time financial analytics and stock prediction, delivering actionable insights to support data-driven investment strategies.

### Mobile & Web Development
- **[JobMingle: Resume Screening App](https://github.com/atchudhansg/jobmingle-resume-screening-app)**  
  Intelligent recruitment platform developed with Flutter and Firebase that automates resume screening using machine learning. Its custom matching algorithm achieves 90% accuracy, significantly reducing candidate screening time.
